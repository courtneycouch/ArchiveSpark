# Contribute

Everyone is very welcome to contribute to ArchiveSpark. If you encounter any bugs, which you would like to report to us, please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark/issues). Of course, as everything is open source, you can also fix bugs yourself and file a pull request. We will then review your changes and potentially integrate your fix.

In order to extend the functionality of ArchiveSpark with additional [Enrichment Functions](EnrichFuncs.md) and [Data Specifications](DataSpecs.md), we strongly encourage you to share these with others in separate projects / repos. ArchiveSpark's flexible architecture enables easy integration of those modules from other projects, while we would like to keep the core repository clean with a focus on the basic features.

As an example, we have created a project to demonstrate how to extend ArchiveSpark, which can be used as a template. It includes some very simple DataSpecs as well as Enrichment Functions to analyze digitized books from the Internet Archive remotely with ArchiveSpark using local XML meta data: [IABooksOnArchiveSpark](https://github.com/helgeho/IABooksOnArchiveSpark)
